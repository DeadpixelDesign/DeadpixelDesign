## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, hello and hola! Iâ€™m Pedro E. Matos NuÃ±ez aka @DeadpixelDesign aka Deadman Hangman

ðŸ‘€ As a fellow Daoist, I'm currently interested in mastering the ultimate Dao of Fullstack Web Development, specifically the following technologies:

- CSS
- Sass
- Tailwind (to replace Bootstrap)
- Javascript
- Typescript
- Node,js

- MongoDB, MySQL & Postgre
- React, Redux, Next.js
- Vue, Vuex & Nuxt.js
- Svelte & SvelteKit
- PHP & Laravel
- Python & Django
- Headless Wordpress
- GraphQL
- JSON

### About Me
Been working in the field since 2007 maintaining a legacy site built in PHP, working with AMS systems (iMis, Netforum/Avectra, i4a), Drupal and Wordpress, building emails with MJML, and dabling in ColdFusion.
Also work with Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, Premier (for simple video editing). Been currently using the Affinity suite to try to replace Abode in my workflow, Designer, Photo and Publisher.

### What Am I Doing Now?
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Svelte and planning on buiding a personal tech. blog to record my journey of a thousand li in Fullstack Web Development.

### Need Exchange Dao Teachings?
Currently, it was possible to connact me in Twitter but as it has turned as toxic as League of Legend game lobby, I decided to leave the platform.
I have plans for Instagram, Facebook and Substack Notes
